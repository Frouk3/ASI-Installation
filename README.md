# ASI-Installation
This readme.md guide you how to install asi scripts for some specific game


## Installation
1 - Download mod
If mod contains only .asi script, you need to download last version of asi loader https://github.com/ThirteenAG/Ultimate-ASI-Loader/releases
Create folder named "scripts" and move folder and dinput8.dll from Ultimate-ASI-Loader archive to root game directory
2 - Move files from mod archive to game root directory with replacement
If its only .asi, move it to scripts folder

If every step were successful, mod should work!

## Notes
If mod is archive, you'll just need to see if its contains dinput8.dll and scripts folder
